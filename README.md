# Quadcopter
my quadcopter works manually and automatic 
in automatic -> works wih sms
1) user send "On" to quadcopter's number 
2) then quad sends back its coordinate to user and ask "where you want i go?"
3) then user must send longitude and latitude to quadcopter 
4) via AI algorithm , fly to those coordinate (not yet completed)

used moudules :
-> GPS-neo6mv2 (for finding coordinate) 
-> compass-gy271 (for finding direction)
-> Simcard-sim800l (for communicating with quad)
